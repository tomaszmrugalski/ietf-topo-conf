      <t>
DHCP servers have evolved over the years to provide significant
functionality beyond that which is described in the DHCP base
specifications.  One aspect of this functionality is support for
context-specific configuration information.  This memo describes some
such features and makes recommendations as to how they can be used.

    <section title="Introduction">

      <t>
The <xref target="RFC2131">DHCPv4</xref> and <xref target="RFC3315">
DHCPv6</xref> protocol specifications describe how addresses can be
allocated to clients based on network topology information provided by
the DHCP relay infrastructure.  Address allocation decisions are
integral to the allocation of addresses and prefixes in DHCP.
      </t>

      <t>
The DHCP protocol also describes mechanisms for provisioning devices
with additional configuration information; for example, <xref
target="RFC1034">DNS</xref> server addresses, default DNS search
domains, and similar information.
      </t>

      <t>
Although it was the intent of the authors of these specifications that
DHCP servers would provision devices with configuration information
appropriate to each device's location on the network, this practice
was never documented, much less described in detail.
      </t>

      <t>
Existing DHCP server implementations do in fact provide such
capabilities; the goal of this document is to describe those
capabilities for the benefit both of operators and of protocol
designers who may wish to use DHCP as a means for configuring their
own services, but may not be aware of the capabilities provided by
most modern DHCP servers.

      <t>
Those diagrams allow us to represent a variety of different network
configurations and illustrate how existing DHCP servers can provide
configuration information customized to the particular location from
which a client is making its request.
      </t>

      <t>
It is important to understand the background of how DHCP works when
considering those diagrams. It is assumed that the DHCP clients may not have
routable IP addresses when they are attempting to obtain configuration
information.
      </t>

      <t>
The reason for making this assumption is that one of the functions of
DHCP is to bootstrap the DHCP client's IP address configuration; if
the client does not yet have an IP address configured, it cannot
route packets to an off-link DHCP server, therefore some kind of relay
mechanism is required.
      </t>

      <t>
The details of how packet delivery between clients and servers works
are different between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6,
but the essence is the same: whether or not the client actually has an
IP configuration, it generally communicates with the DHCP server by
sending its requests to a DHCP relay agent on the local link; this
relay agent, which has a routable IP address, then forwards the DHCP
requests to the DHCP server (directly or via other relays). In later
stages of the configuration when the client has acquired an address
and certain conditions are met, it is possible for the client to
send packets directly to the server, thus bypassing the relays.
The conditions for such behavior are different for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
and are discussed in sections <xref target="v4-behavior"/> and
<xref target="v6-behavior"/>.</t>

      <t>To determine the client's point of attachment and link specific
      configuration, the server typically uses the client facing IP address of
      the relay agent. In some cases the server may use the routable IP address
      of the client, if the client has the routable IP address assigned to its
      interface and it is transmitted in the DHCP message.  The server is then
      able to determine the client's point of attachment and select appropriate
      subnet- or link-specific configuration.
      </t>

      <t>Sometimes it is useful for the relay agents to provide additional
      information about the topology. A number of extensions have been defined for
      this purpose. The specifics are different, but the core principle
      remains the same: the relay agent knows exactly where the original
      request came from, so it provides an identifier that will help
      the server to choose appropriate address pool and configuration
      parameters. Examples of such options are mentioned in the following
      sections.</t>

      <t>Finally, clients may be connected to the same link as the
      server, so no relay agents are required. In such cases, the
      DHCPv4 server typically uses the IPv4 address assigned to the
      network interface over which the transmission was received to
      select an appropriate subnet. This is more complicated for DHCPv6,
      as the DHCPv6 server is not required to have any globally unique
      addresses. In such cases, additional configuration information
      may need to be required. Some servers allow indicating that a given subnet
      is directly reachable over a specific local network interface.</t>

  <section anchor="v4-behavior" title="DHCPv4 Specific Behavior">
    
    <t>In some cases in DHCPv4, when a DHCPv4 client has a routable
    IPv4 address, the message is unicast to the DHCPv4 server rather
    than going through a relay agent. Examples of such transmissions
    are renewal (DHCPREQUEST) and address release (DHCPRELEASE).</t>

    <t>The relay agent that receives client's message sets giaddr
    field to the address of the network interface the message was
    received on. The relay agent may insert a relay agent option
    <xref target="RFC3046"/>.</t>

    <t>There are several options defined that are useful for subnet
    selection in DHCPv4. <xref target="RFC3527" /> defines the Link
    Selection sub-option that is inserted by a relay agent. This option
    is particularly useful when the relay agent needs to specify the
    subnet/link on which a DHCPv4 client resides, which is different
    from an IP address that can be used to communicate with the relay
    agent. The Virtual Subnet Selection sub-option, specified in <xref
    target="RFC6607" />, can also be added by a relay agent to specify
    information in a VPN environment. In certain cases, it is useful
    for the client itself to specify the Virtual Subnet Selection option,
    e.g. when there are no relay agents involved during the VPN set up
    process.</t>

    <t>Another option that may influence the subnet selection is the
    IPv4 Subnet Selection Option, defined in <xref target="RFC3011"/>,
    which allows the client to explicitly request allocation from
    a given subnet.</t>

  </section>

  <section anchor="v6-behavior" title="DHCPv6 Specific Behavior">

    <t>In DHCPv6 unicast communication is possible in case where the
    server is configured with a Server Unicast option (see Section
    22.12 in <xref target="RFC3315" />) and clients are able to take
    advantage of it. In such cases, once a client is assigned a,
    presumably global, address, it is able to contact the server
    directly, bypassing any relays. It should be noted that such a mode is
    completely controllable by administrators in DHCPv6.  (They may
    simply choose to not configure server unicast option, thus forcing
    clients to send their messages always via relay agents in every
    case).</t>

    <t>In the DHCPv6 protocol, there are two core mechanisms defined
    in <xref target="RFC3315"/> that allow a server to distinguish which
    link the relay agent is connected to.  The first mechanism is the
    link-address field in the Relay-forward and Relay-reply
    messages. Somewhat contrary to its name, relay agents insert in
    the link-address field an address that is typically global and can
    be used to uniquely identify the link on which the client is
    located. In normal circumstances this is the solution that is
    easiest to maintain, as existing address assignments can be used
    and no additional administrative actions (like assigning dedicated
    identifiers for each relay agent, making sure they are unique and
    maintaining a list of such identifiers) are needed. It requires,
    however, for the relay agent to have an address with a scope
    larger than link-local configured on its client-facing
    interface.</t>

    <t>The second mechanism uses Interface-Id option (see Section
    22.18 of <xref target="RFC3315" />) inserted by the relay agent,
    which identifies the link that the client is connected to.
    This mechanism may be used for example, when the relay agent
    does not have a globally unique address or ULA <xref
    target="RFC4193"/> configured on the client-facing interface) on
    the client facing interface, thus making the first mechanism
    not feasible. If the interface-id is unique within an
    administrative domain, the interface-id value may be used to
    select the appropriate subnet. As there is no guarantee for the
    uniqueness (<xref target="RFC3315"/> only mandates the
    interface-id to be unique within a single relay agent context), it
    is up to the administrator to check whether the relay agents
    deployed use unique interface-id values. If the interface-id values
    are not unique, the Interface-id option can not be used to determine
    the client's point of attachment.</t>

    <t>It should be noted that Relay-forward and Relay-reply
    messages are exchanged between relays and servers only. Clients
    are never exposed to those messages. Also, servers never receive
    Relay-reply messages. Relay agents must be able to process both
    Relay-forward (sending already relayed message further towards the
    server, when there is more than one relay agent in a chain) and
    Relay-reply (when sending back the response towards the client,
    when there is more than one relay agent in a chain).</t>

    <t>For completeness, we also mention an uncommon, but valid case,
    where relay agents use a link-local address in the link-address
    field in relayed Relay-forward messages. This may happen if the
    relay agent doesn't have any address with a larger scope on the
    interface connected to that specific link. Even
    though link-local addresses cannot be automatically used to
    associate relay agent with a given link, with additional
    configuration information the server may still able to select
    the proper link. That requires the DHCP server software to be able to
    specify relay agent link-address associated with each link or
    a feature similar to 'shared
    subnets' (see <xref target="shared-subnets" />). Both may or may
    not be supported by the server software. Network
    administrator has to manually configure additional information
    that a given subnet uses a relay agent with link-address
    X. Alternatively, if the relay agent uses link address X and
    relays messages from a subnet A, an administrator can configure
    that subnet A is a shared subnet with a very small X/128
    subnet. That is not a recommended configuration, but in cases
    where it is impossible for relay agents to get an address from the
    subnet they are relaying from, it may be a viable solution.</t>

    <t>DHCPv6 also has support for more finely grained link
    identification, using <xref target="RFC6221">Lightweight DHCPv6
    Relay Agents</xref> (LDRA).  In this case, the link-address field
    is set to Unspecified_address (::), but the DHCPv6 server also receives an
    Interface-Id option from the relay agent that can be used to more
    precisely identify the client's location on the network.</t>

    <t>What this means in practice is that the DHCP server in all
    cases has sufficient information to pinpoint, at the very least,
    the layer 3 link to which the client is connected, and in some
    cases which layer 2 link the client is connected to, when the
    layer 3 link is aggregated out of multiple layer 2 links.</t>

    <t>In all cases, then, the DHCPv6 server will have a
    link-identifying IP address, and in some cases it may also have a
    link-specific identifier (e.g. Interface-Id Option or Link Address
    Option defined in Section 5 of <xref target="RFC6977" />).  It
    should be noted that there the link-specific identifier is unique
    only within the scope of the link-identifying IP address. For example,
    link-specific identifier of "eth0" for a relay agent with IPv4 address
    2001:db8::1 means something different than "eth0" for a relay agent
    with address 2001:db8::2.</t>

    <t>It is also possible for link-specific identifiers to be nested,
    so that the actual identifier that identifies the link is an
    aggregate of two or more link-specific identifiers sent by a set
    of LDRAs in a chain; in general this functions exactly as if a
    single identifier were received from a single LDRA, so we do not
    treat it specially in the discussion below, but sites that use
    chained LDRA configurations will need to be aware of this when
    configuring their DHCPv6 servers.</t>

    <t>The Virtual Subnet Selection Options, present in DHCPv4, are also
    defined for DHCPv6. The use case is the same as in DHCPv4: the relay
    agent inserts VSS options that can help the server to select the
    appropriate subnet with its address pool and associated configuration
    options. See <xref target="RFC6607" /> for details.</t>

Consider <xref target="simple-network"/> in the context of a simple

A, B, C and D in this example are represented in the diagram as IP
routers with an embedded relay function, because this is a very
typical configuration, but the relay function can also be provided in
a separate node on each link.
      </t>

      <t>
In a simple network like this, there may be no need for link-specific
configuration in DHCPv6, since local routing information is delivered
through router advertisements.  However, in IPv4, it is very typical
to configure the default route using DHCP; in this case, the default
route will be different on each link.  In order to accomplish this,
the DHCP server will need link-specific configuration for the
default route.
      </t>

      <t>
To illustrate, we will use an example from a hypothetical DHCP server
that uses a simple JSON notation <xref target="RFC7159"/> for
configuration. Although we know of no DHCP server that uses this
specific syntax, most modern DHCP server provides similar functionality.

      <t>
In <xref target="fig-config-example1"/>, we see a configuration
example for this scenario: a set of prefixes, each of which has a set
of options and a list of links for which it is on-link.  We have
defined one option for each prefix: a routers option.  This option
contains a list of values; each list only has one value, and that
value is the IP address of the router specific to the prefix.
      </t>

      <t>
When the DHCP server receives a request, it searches the list of
prefixes for one that encloses the link-identifying IP address
provided by the client or relay agent.  The DHCP server then examines
the options list associated with that prefix and returns those options
to the client.
      </t>

      <t>
So for example a client connected to link A in the example would have
a link-identifying IP address within the 192.0.2.0/26 prefix, so the
DHCP server would match it to that prefix.  Based on the
configuration, the DHCP server would then return a routers option
containing a single IP address: 192.0.2.1.  A client on link F would
have a link-identifying address in the 192.0.2.128/26 prefix, and would
receive a routers option containing the IP address 192.0.2.129.
      </t>

    <section title="Relay Agent Running on a Host">
      <t>A relay agent is DHCP software that may be run on any IP
      node. Although it is typically run on a router, this is by no
      means required by the DHCP protocol.  The relay agent is simply
      a service that operates on a link, receiving link-local
      multicasts (IPv6) or broadcasts (IPv4) and relaying them, using IP routing, to
      a DHCP server.  As long as the relay has an IP address on the
      link, and a default route or more specific route through which
      it can reach a DHCP server, it need not be a router, or even
      have multiple interfaces.</t>

      <t>A relay agent can be run on a host connected to two
      links. That case is presented in <xref target="complex-network"/>.
      There is router B that is connected to links D and E. At the same
      time there is also a host that is connected to the same links. The
      relay agent software is running on that host. That is uncommon,
      but a valid configuration.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Cascaded Relays">
      <t>Let's observe another case, shown in <xref target="complex-network"/>.
      Note that in this configuration, the clients connected to link G will
      send their requests to relay D which will forward its packets directly
      to the DHCP server. That is typical, but not the only possible configuration.
      It is possible to configure relay agent D to forward client messages to
      relay E which in turn will send it to the DHCP server. This configuration
      is sometimes referred to as cascade relay agents.</t>

      <t>Note that the relaying mechanism works differently in DHCPv4 and in
      DHCPv6. In DHCPv4 only the first relay is able to set the giaddr field in
      the DHCPv4 packet. Any following relays that receive that packet will not
      change it as the server needs giaddr information from the first relay
      (i.e. the closest to the client). The server will send the response back to
      the giaddr address, which is the address of the first relay agent that
      saw the client's message. That means that the client messages travel on a
      different path than the server's responses. A message from client connected
      to link G will travel via relay D, relay E and to the server. A response
      message will be sent from the server to relay D via router B, and relay D
      will send it to the client on link G.</t>

      <t>Relaying in DHCPv6 is more structured. Each relay agent encapsulates
      a packet that is destined to the server and sends it towards the server.
      Depending on the configuration, that can be a server's unicast address,
      a multicast address or next relay agent address. The next relay repeats
      the encapsulation process. Although the resulting packet is more complex
      (may have up to 32 levels of encapsulation if the packet traveled through 32 relays),
      every relay may insert its own options and it is clear which relay agent
      inserted which option.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Regional Configuration Example">

      <t>
In the <xref target="complex-network"/> example, link C is a regional
backbone for an ISP.  Link E is
also a regional backbone for that ISP.  Relays A, B, C and D are PE
routers, and Links A, B, F and G are actually link aggregators with
individual layer 2 circuits to each customer&mdash;for example, the
relays might be DSLAMs or cable head-end systems.  At each customer
site we assume there is a single CPE device attached to the link.
      </t>

      <t>
We further assume that links A, B, F and G are each addressed by a
single prefix, although it would be equally valid for each CPE device
to be numbered on a separate prefix.
      </t>

      <t>
In a real-world deployment, there would likely be many more than two
PE routers connected to each regional backbone; we have kept the
number small for simplicity.
      </t>

      <t>
In the example presented in <xref target="example-regions" />, the
goal is to configure all the devices within a region with server
addresses local to that region, so that service traffic does not have
to be routed between regions unnecessarily.

      <t>
In this example, when a request comes in to the DHCP server with a
link-identifying IP address in the 2001:DB8::/40 prefix, it is
identified as being on link A.  The DHCPv6 server then looks on the list
of links to see what region the client is in.  Link A is identified as
being in omashu.  The DHCPv6 server then looks up omashu in the set of
regions, and discovers a list of region-specific options.
      </t>

      <t>
The DHCP server then resolves the domain names listed in the options
and sends a sip-server option containing the IP addresses that the
resolver returned for sip.omashu.example.org, and a dns-server option
containing the IP addresses returned by the resolver for
dns1.omashu.example.org and dns2.omashu.example.org. Depending on the
server capability and configuration, it may cache resolved responses
for specific period of time, repeat queries every time or even keep
the response until reconfiguration or shutdown. For more detailed
discussion see Section 7 of <xref target="RFC7227" />.</t>

      <t>
Similarly, if the DHCP server receives a request from a DHCP client
where the link-identifying IP address is contained by the prefix
2001:DB8:300::/40, then the DHCP server identifies the client as
being connected to link G.  The DHCP server then identifies link G as
being in the gaoling region, and returns the sip-servers and
dns-servers options specific to that region.
      </t>

      <t>As with the previous example, the exact configuration syntax and
      structure shown above does not precisely match what existing DHCP servers
      do, but the behavior illustrated in this example can be accomplished with
      most existing modern DHCP servers.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="shared-subnets" title="Multiple subnets on the same link">
      <t>There are scenarios where there is more than one subnet from the same
      protocol family (i.e. two or more IPv4 subnets or two or more IPv6
      subnets) configured on the same link. Such a configuration is often
      referred to as 'shared subnets' in Unix environments or 'multinet' in
      Microsoft terminology.</t>

      <t>The most frequently mentioned use case is a network renumbering where
      some services are migrated to the new addressing scheme, but some aren't
      yet.</t>

      <t>Second example is expanding the allocation space. In DHCPv4 and for
      DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation, there could be cases where multiple subnets are
      needed, because a single subnet may be too small to accommodate the client
      population.</t>

      <t>The third use case covers allocating addresses (or delegation prefixes)
      that are not the same as topological information. For example, the
      link-address is on prefix X and the addresses to be delegated is on prefix
      Y. This could be based on differentiating information (i.e., whether
      device is CPE or CM in DOCSIS) or just because the link-address/giaddr is
      different from the actual allocation space.</t>

      <t>The fourth use case is a cable network, where cable modems and the
      devices connected behind them are connected to the same layer 2
      link. However, operators want the cable modems and user devices to get
      addresses from distinct address spaces, so users couldn't easily access
      their modems management interfaces.</t>

      <t>To support such a configuration, additional differentiating
      information is required. Many DHCP server implementations offer a feature
      that is typically called client classification. The server segregates
      incoming packets into one or more classes based on certain packet
      characteristics, e.g. presence or value of certain options or even a
      match between existing options. Servers require additional information to
      handle such configuration, as they cannot use the topographical property
      of the relay addresses alone to properly choose a subnet. Exact details
      of such operation is not part of the DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 protocols and
      is implementation dependent.</t>
